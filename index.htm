                <h2>Grilled Beef & Vegetable Kebabs</h2>
                <p>These easy grilled beef & vegetable kebabs are not only delicious--they're economical too. Tri-tip is an inexpensive and flavorful 
                    cut of beef that takes beautifully to cooking over an open flame. Thread it onto skewers with colorful veggies and marinate for up 
                    to eight hours before cooking on the grill or over your campfire. Either way, it's a healthy and tasty summer meal.
